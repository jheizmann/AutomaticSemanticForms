Automatic Semantic Forms extension ChangeLog
===============================

VERsION 1.3

CHANGES
* The #shownow Parser Function has finally been deprecated. Please use the #show Parser Function instead.
* The 'Use class' property is now used differently:
** For categories, the CSS class is assigned to a div that surround the complete section for that category, including the table with the form input fiellds.
** For properties, the class is assigned to the table row, that surrounds the form input field and not to the form input field itself anymore.

FEATURES
* ASF now works without templateless. Annotations in the standard syntax are now used to automatically generate  the form and to fill the form input fields with values.
** The 'CreateSilentAnnotations' Parser Function is not needed anymore, although it still works.
* The asfforminput parser function now also supports the popup property, which enables you to display an ASF in a popup.

VERSION 1.2

CHANGES
* Categories now inherit 'Use display template' and 'use preload article' annotations from their super categories. 
* The 'No automatic formedit' annotation can now also be used for properties.

FEATURES
* Support for the One-STep-Creation process added.
* Free text input field can be hidden via the 'Hide free text input' annotation.

VERSION 1.1

FEATURES
* New special page Special:AutomaticSemanticForms added. Page enables users 
to materialize automatically created Semantic Forms.
* Property:No_automatic_formedit can now also be used for properties. Properties with such an
annotation will not be shown in automatically created SFs.
* asfforminput parser function now has an optional parameter to display available properties in a dropdown.
* Semantic Forms are now also created automatically, if all category annotations of an instance are not
the domain of any Property. In this case, the automatically crreated Semantic Form will only display a freetex
input field and some information about the categories, which are not the domain of any property.
